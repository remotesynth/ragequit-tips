Burnout is a serious issue facing many people. It is often related to a person's work but can also be caused by activities outside of work that can have a negative impact on a person's desire and ability to participate in  things they normally enjoy. This is a community-maintained and curated list of resources intended to help anyone facing burnout themselves, confronting burnout in a friend or colleague or just curious about an important and pervasive issue.
